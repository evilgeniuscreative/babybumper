A game in which you can move a baby around a living room and knock over objects to score

## EPIC: As a computer game player I want a game where I can control a baby crawling around the living room tipping over things and laughing.

## STORIES:

1. As a playah, I want images that are fun and engaging that flesh out this living room and the baby in the game.
2. As a player, I want to be able to control the baby moving around the living room using the arrow keys.
3. As a player, I want to be able to gain score points as the baby tips over objects, the number of points are correlated with the value of the object tipped over. Objects are tipped over when the baby touches them.
4. As a player I want the game to be over when all the objects that can be tipped over are, and see a fun ending splash screen.
